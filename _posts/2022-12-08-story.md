## Our Goal
If you've been following along my blog posts, you'll remember that I was trying to figure if there is really an advantage to an MLB team having more fans at their games. I [scraped data](https://jdradandt.github.io/stat386-projects/2022/10/18/web-scraping.html) from the internet to do this analysis, than did some [exploratory data analysis](https://jdradandt.github.io/stat386-projects/2022/11/17/EDA.html) to see what kind of information the data was telling us. We found that it was better to look at the percentage of the stadium's capacity that was filled than the raw attendance number, and that there did seem to be some postive correlation between attendance and wins in a season.

## The Story
My favorite baseball team in the Boston Red Sox. I have followed them almost religiously since I was 4 years old, and from April-October, my happiness almost relies on whether or not they are winning (If you follow the MLB, you know 2022 was a rough year). I try to go to Red Sox games whenever I can, and I truly want to believe that if I go and cheer as loud as I can, I am helping them perform better. To see if that is a reasonable belief, I put together this line chart of percent of capacity at Red Sox games by season, and their wins in each season.

What is this data telling me? Well, Red Sox home attendance seems to be pretty consistent, almost always filling their home stadium above 95% capacity. However, wins are much less consistent. So, Red Sox fans are faithful, no matter how good the team is, while attendance at games played on the road seems to be more reliant on the performance of the team. And do fans showing up seem to help the Red Sox? It doesn't seem like it. Instead, I think the team's *performance* affects *how many people attend game*. But, good or bad, I will keep going to a Red Sox game as often as I can. And if they win, I'll still take some of the credit.

Thank you for following along this exploration! If you are interested in the code used to gather and clean the data, the EDA, or make this graphic, see [this repo](https://github.com/jdradandt/mlb_ballpark_analysis).
