I did not have much familiarity with programming languages when I started Python. Some of the first things a beginner to Python learns are the different data types Python supports. `str`, `int`, `float`, `bool` all make enough sense; even `list` is simple enough. But a dictionary? That threw me off, and I could never find just a basic summary of working with dictionaries. So if you find yourself in a similar boat, hopefully you will find this useful. 
### What is a dictionary?
Simply put, a dictionary is like a list, but instead of using numbers as an index, values in a dictionary are indexed by _keys_. So while I would use `mylist[0]` to access the first item in `mylist`, I would use `mydict[first_key]` to access the first item in a dictionary. (Note: `first_key` can be a string or an integer)

Dictionaries are created by using curly brackets `{}`. Within the brackets, the key and value(s) are seperated by a colon `:` and a comma `,` seperates the keys. For example, below is how we could create a dictionary that contains some universities are their nicknames:

```
nicknames = {'BYU':'Cougars', 'Texas':'Longhorns', 'USC':'Trojans', 'Nebraska':'Cornhuskers'
```
