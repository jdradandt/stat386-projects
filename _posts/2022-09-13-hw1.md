I did not have much familiarity with programming languages when I started Python. Some of the first things a beginner to Python learns are the different data types Python supports. `str`, `int`, `float`, `bool` all make enough sense; even `list` is simple enough. But a dictionary? That threw me off, and I could never find just a basic summary of working with dictionaries. So if you find yourself in a similar boat, hopefully you will find this useful.

### What is a dictionary?
Simply put, a dictionary is like a list, but instead of using numbers as an index, values in a dictionary are indexed by _keys_. So while I would use `mylist[0]` to access the first item in `mylist`, I would use `mydict[first_key]` to access the first item in a dictionary. (Note: `first_key` can be a string or an integer) Every key in a dictionary must be unique and is immuteable (i.e. cannot be changed).


### How to create a dictionary
Dictionaries are created by using curly brackets `{}`. Within the brackets, the key and value(s) are seperated by a colon `:` and a comma `,` seperates the keys. For example, below is how we could create a dictionary that contains some universities are their nicknames:

```
nicknames = {'BYU':'Cougars', 
             'Texas':'Longhorns', 
             'USC':'Trojans', 
             'Nebraska':'Cornhuskers'}
```
The keys in this dictionary are the names of the school, and the values are the nickname for each school.

You can also create a dictionary using `dict()`, which builds dictionaries directly from sequences of key-value pairs:

```
nicknames = dict([('BYU', 'Cougars), ('Texas', 'Longhorns'), ('USC', 'Trojans'), ('Nebraska', 'Cornhuskers')])
```

For a more ways to create a dictionary, especially dict comprehesion, see https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html#dictionaries.

### How to access items in the dictionary
You are probably familiar with how to index lists, and indexing dictionaries is similar. The biggest difference, as mentioned above, is what the index is. In a list, `mylist[0]` will return the first value in `mylist`. However, `nicknames[0]` returns an error. This is because values in dictionaries cannot be accessed except by with their keys. So in the case of
