I did not have much familiarity with programming languages when I started Python. Some of the first things a beginner to Python learns are the different data types Python supports. `str`, `int`, `float`, `bool` all make enough sense; even `list` is simple enough. But a dictionary? That threw me off, and I could never find just a basic summary of working with dictionaries. So if you find yourself in a similar boat, hopefully you will find this useful.

The point of this blog is to try and figure out how to make this the best blog I can. Hopefully the picture above worked, as well as the header for this section. I want this blog to be a place that I can show to employers so they can understand my skills as a data scientist. This could be tough because writing isn't really my thing!
