Time is a really interesting thing. As far as I can think, it is the only thing that all humans have completely equal– we all have 24 hours in the day, and that doesn’t change for anyone. No one can tell another person that they “have more time” than they do, because that is blatantly false. What differs is what we do with our time. Some people are scheduled, appointment-making people– they have planners that are filled in for each minute of the day, and if you ask them to get lunch the morning-of, they will say they are busy, but they are free next Tuesday. Then there are the people on the other side, who seem to have only free time and you know they will always be free for whatever you need. Which one is better? It seems very productive to always know what you’re doing, and it seems like I would maximize my time more if I had a good schedule and plan for my day. On the other hand, what if my wife finishes work early and we can go on an impromptu date, or a friend randomly calls me to play basketball? Maybe it is better to have a flexible schedule that accounts for random or unexpected occurrences. I’m still figuring out exactly how I want to manage my time, in a way that is productive yet flexible.
