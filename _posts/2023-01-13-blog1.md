Communication is important because it is the only way that anything can get done. Communication is how innovations are spread; imagine if Thomas Edison couldn’t communicate that he had created the lightbulb, or couldn’t communicate how to reproduce it. In fact, would he have even been able to create the lightbulb if there wasn’t good communication for previous scientific breakthroughs? Good communication keeps the world connected and keeps it moving, so that we know one another, what we’ve done and what we’re doing, so we share ideas and create things instead of being stuck because there is only so much we can do by ourselves. I am sure that there have been many brilliant ideas in the history of the world that have gotten nowhere because the person who had the idea wasn’t able to effectively communicate their idea to others. Good communication prevents confusion and frustration and facilitates learning and growth.
