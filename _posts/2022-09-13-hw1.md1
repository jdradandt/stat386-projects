## The point of this blog
The point of this blog is to try and figure out how to make this the best blog I can. Hopefully the picture above worked, as well as the header for this section. I want this blog to be a place that I can show to employers so they can understand my skills as a data scientist. This could be tough because writing isn't really my thing!
