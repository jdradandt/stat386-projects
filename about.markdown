# About Me

Hi, I'm Jackson. I am a junior at BYU studying Statistics with an emphasis in Data Science. I am passionate about data and value the importance of knowing how to properly and ethically deal with it. I hope this blog can be a platform to show my work and facilitate conversation for best data science practice.
